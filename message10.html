      <h1>Happy Birthday!</h1>
      <p>To my dearest Korine,
        You’re no longer a little girl, but someone who has just blossomed into a stunningly beautiful young woman! I may not share this often, but I pray for you all the time. That the love for the Faith that you have carries you through these next several years. I pray the love of Christ carries you through the tumultuous times you are sure to go through. I pray you are always a beacon of Christ’s light.</p>
