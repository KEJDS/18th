      <p>HAPPY 18TH BIRTHDAY, KORINE!!

        Now that you're officially an adult, I know you’re going to do amazing things. But I hope you’ll still have time to hang out with us and do all the fun stuff we’ve always done together. You’re not just my a friend, you’re like a family as well.
        
        Have an awesome birthday! You deserve all the happiness and fun in the world.
