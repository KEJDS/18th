        first of all, thank u for staying by my side and being a great all these years. kahit na di tayo always nag uusap and very bihira lang magkita, i’m glad na na-maintain natin yung friendship natin 🫶 being the so-called best friend of someone as bright, dazzling, and cheerful as u has been one of the greatest things i treasure in my life 💕 grade 7 me would be so happy knowing that the cute girl in the corner of the classroom, the classmate she always dreamed of being besties with because she can see how great of a friend she would be, has been her best friend for 6 years now 🥹 happiest birthday my korineee 😚 cheers to making more memories together and good luck to us as we enter college 🫡 i luv sm my marecakes! may u continue to be the amazing person u are 💗</p>
